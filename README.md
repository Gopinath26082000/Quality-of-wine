# Quality-of-wine
Project Overview

This project predicts the quality of wine based on various chemical properties using a machine learning model. The system is built with a structured backend for data processing and modeling, and a user-friendly frontend for prediction and visualization.

Features

Backend:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Random Forest Model for Prediction

Frontend:

Home Page

Prediction Page

Dashboard for Visualization of Predictions

Tech Stack

Backend: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

Frontend: Streamlit
